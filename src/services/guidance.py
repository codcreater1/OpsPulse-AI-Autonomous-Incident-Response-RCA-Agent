"""Deterministic guidance for one incident: what state it is in, why, and what a person can do next.

No LLM is involved, so this works when the provider is rate-limited or unconfigured, costs nothing, and is
exactly reproducible. Every sentence is derived from stored fields (status, error category, gate checks, attempt
trace, patch) and from the operating rules in docs/RUNBOOK.md. It never claims a fix is correct.
