# API reference

Generated from the application's OpenAPI schema by `python -m scripts.export_api_docs` (a unit test fails when this file is out of date). The live, interactive version is served at `/docs`.

**Authentication.** Send an API key as `X-API-Key: <key>` or `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Roles: `reporter` (submit and read), `reviewer` (also decide remediation), `admin`. The Sentry webhook is authenticated by its HMAC signature instead.

## Incidents

### `GET /incidents`

Newest first. Filter e.g. `?status=awaiting_approval` to find proposals waiting for review.

**Auth:** API key or Bearer token

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `status` | query | one of `queued`, `processing`, `failed`, `needs_review`, `analysis_ready`, `awaiting_approval`, `remediation_rejected`, `pr_created`, `pr_skipped_duplicate`, `pr_failed` or null |  |  |
| `repo_name` | query | string or null |  |  |
| `limit` | query | integer |  |  |
| `cursor` | query | string or null |  |  |

| 503 | Database unavailable or authentication not configured |
| 400 | Bad Request |
| 422 | Validation Error |

### `POST /webhook/incident`

Accept an incident report (roles: reporter, reviewer, admin).

The incident is queued and analysed by a worker (poll `GET /incidents/{id}`), or synchronously with `wait=true`.

**Auth:** API key or Bearer token

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `wait` | query | boolean |  | Run the analysis synchronously and return the full result |

**JSON body**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `repo_name` | string | yes | GitHub 'owner/repo'. Must be listed in ALLOWED_REPOSITORIES. |
| `error_message` | string | yes |  |
| `stack_trace` | string |  |  |
| `incident_id` | string or null |  | Optional client-generated id. Re-sending the same id is idempotent (no re-analysis). |

| 401 | Missing or invalid API key |
| 403 | Role not allowed, repository not allowed, or self-approval |
| 503 | Database unavailable or authentication not configured |

| 409 | Conflict |
| 429 | Per-identity rate limit exceeded (see Retry-After) |

### `GET /incidents/{incident_id}`

Read Incident

**Auth:** API key or Bearer token

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `incident_id` | path | string | yes |  |

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Successful Response |
| 401 | Missing or invalid API key |
| 403 | Role not allowed, repository not allowed, or self-approval |
| 503 | Database unavailable or authentication not configured |
| 404 | Not Found |
| 422 | Validation Error |

### `POST /incidents/{incident_id}/retry`

Re-queue a `failed` incident (roles: reviewer, admin), e.g. after a provider quota reset.

**Auth:** API key or Bearer token

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `incident_id` | path | string | yes |  |

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Successful Response |

| 503 | Database unavailable or authentication not configured |
| 404 | Not Found |
| 409 | Conflict |
| 422 | Validation Error |

### `POST /incidents/{incident_id}/ask`

Ask a question about one incident (roles: reporter, reviewer, admin).

Common questions (why not accepted, what to do next, what the patch changes) are answered by rules from the
record without an LLM (`source=rules`); others go to the model, which must cite the record sections it used and
whose quoted text is verified against the record. If the model is unavailable the deterministic guidance is
returned (`degraded=true`). The server keeps no conversation state; `history` is client-held and untrusted. No
answer triggers an action, and none was executed or verified.

**Auth:** API key or Bearer token

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `incident_id` | path | string | yes |  |

**JSON body**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `question` | string | yes | A question about this incident's record |
| `history` | list of AskTurn |  | Earlier turns of the conversation (client-held, untrusted); only used to resolve references |

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Successful Response |
| 401 | Missing or invalid API key |
| 403 | Role not allowed, repository not allowed, or self-approval |
| 503 | Database unavailable or authentication not configured |
| 404 | Not Found |
| 429 | Question rate limit exceeded (see Retry-After) |
| 502 | The LLM provider could not answer |
| 504 | The LLM provider timed out |
| 422 | Validation Error |

### `GET /incidents/{incident_id}/guidance`

What state the incident is in, why, and what a person can do next - derived deterministically from the
stored record and the runbook (no LLM, always available). Never claims a fix is correct.

**Auth:** API key or Bearer token

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `incident_id` | path | string | yes |  |

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Successful Response |
| 401 | Missing or invalid API key |
| 403 | Role not allowed, repository not allowed, or self-approval |
| 503 | Database unavailable or authentication not configured |
| 404 | Not Found |
| 422 | Validation Error |

## Remediation decisions

### `POST /incidents/{incident_id}/remediation/decision`

Approve or reject the PR proposed for an incident (roles: reviewer, admin).

The request must name the pending approval and echo the SHA-256 of the proposed patch, so a decision can
only apply to the exact change the reviewer saw. The reviewer is the authenticated identity, and it may not
be the identity that submitted the incident (four-eyes rule). Decisions are final; a repeat returns 409.

**Auth:** API key or Bearer token

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `incident_id` | path | string | yes |  |

**JSON body**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |

| `patch_sha256` | string | yes |  |
| `decision` | one of `approve`, `reject` | yes |  |
| `note` | string or null |  |  |

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Successful Response |
| 401 | Missing or invalid API key |
| 403 | Role not allowed, repository not allowed, or self-approval |
| 503 | Database unavailable or authentication not configured |
| 404 | Not Found |
| 409 | Conflict |
| 422 | Validation Error |

## Inbound integrations

### `POST /integrations/sentry`

integration's Client Secret); the Sentry project must be mapped to an allow-listed repository.
