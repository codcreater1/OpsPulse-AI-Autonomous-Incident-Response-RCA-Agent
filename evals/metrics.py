"""Metric definitions. Every metric is a ratio with an explicit numerator and denominator; a metric whose
denominator is 0 is reported as None (not 0, not 1).

All metrics here are deterministic: they compare recorded facts (labels, verified quotes, statuses). No LLM
judge is used. Category labels were assigned by the dataset author, so "accuracy" means agreement with those
labels, not ground truth about real systems.
