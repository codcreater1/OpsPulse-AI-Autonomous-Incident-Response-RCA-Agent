| Metric | Value | n/d | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|
| structured_output_validity | 0.750 | 3/4 | LLM attempts whose reply validated against RCAOutput / LLM attempts (provider errors excluded) |
| category_accuracy | 1.000 | 3/3 | final category == labelled category / cases labelled conclusive |
| evidence_grounding_accuracy | 1.000 | 6/6 | 'observed' quotes found verbatim in their cited source / all 'observed' quotes (final analyses) |
| unsupported_claim_rate | 0.000 | 0/9 | (unverifiable 'observed' quotes + affected files absent from trace/retrieved file) / (all quotes + all affected files) |
| abstention_recall | n/a | 0/0 | inconclusive-labelled cases where the model declared insufficient evidence or category 'unknown' / inconclusive-labelled cases |
| inconclusive_not_accepted_rate | n/a | 0/0 | inconclusive-labelled cases the quality gate did NOT accept / inconclusive-labelled cases |
| false_abstention_rate | 0.000 | 0/3 | conclusive-labelled cases where the model abstained / conclusive-labelled cases |
| gate_acceptance_rate | 1.000 | 3/3 | cases accepted by the quality gate / evaluated cases |
| false_acceptance_rate | 0.000 | 0/3 | accepted cases that are inconclusive-labelled or have the wrong category / accepted cases |
| relevant_file_hit_rate | 0.000 | 0/3 | cases whose affected_files contain a labelled relevant file / cases with labelled files |
| unsupported_acceptance_rate | n/a | 0/0 | unsupported analyses (inconclusive-labelled or with an unverifiable quote) the gate accepted / unsupported analyses |
| workflow_failure_rate | 0.400 | 2/5 | cases ending in workflow status 'failed' (e.g. provider errors) / cases |
