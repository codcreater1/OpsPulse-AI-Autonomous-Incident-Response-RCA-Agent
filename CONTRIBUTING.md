# Contributing

## Development setup

See the README "Setup" section, then install the git hooks:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
```

## Before opening a pull request

Run the same checks as CI:

```bash
ruff check src tests evals scripts migrations
ruff format --check src tests evals scripts migrations
mypy
pytest --cov=src --cov=evals
python -m evals.run_rca --mode mock --min structured_output_validity=0.9 --min evidence_grounding_accuracy=0.95 --min inconclusive_not_accepted_rate=1.0
python -m evals.run_retrieval
```

## Rules of thumb

- **Behaviour changes to prompts, the quality gate or retrieval** must bump the matching version in
  `src/versions.py` and be evaluated on the existing datasets (`evals/`). Report the before/after numbers in
  the pull request; never quote numbers you did not run.
- **Schema changes** need an Alembic revision in `migrations/versions/`; CI checks that the migrated schema
  matches the models (`alembic check`) on PostgreSQL.
- **Side effects** (database writes, GitHub calls) belong in `src/services/`, never in graph nodes.
- **External services** are faked in unit tests; tests that need real credentials go in `tests/integration/`
  and must skip unless `RUN_LIVE_TESTS=1`.
- Do not log or persist secrets, full prompts or source code; use `redact()` for anything that could contain them.
- Architectural decisions with lasting impact get a short record in `docs/adr/`.
